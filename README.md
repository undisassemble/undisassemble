# Hello friendo :wave:

I'm currently in college, majoring in CSEC. My focus is reverse engineering, specifically with Windows applications and PEs. I mainly program in C++, but I also know C, Python, and x86 Intel Assembly.

## Current Projects
- Yet Another Packer (most of my commits go here)

## Past Projects
I may make small changes to these but it is unlikely that they will be continued further
- [InjectDumper](https://github.com/undisassemble/injectdumper)
- [PEFixup](https://github.com/undisassemble/pefixup)

## Languages I Use
